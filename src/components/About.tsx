                <p className="text-muted text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
                    Playdel started on court. Co‑founders <strong className="text-white">Sheis</strong> (Computer Science) and <strong className="text-white">Shumail</strong> (Law)
                    played padel regularly and kept hitting the same wall: finding partners, booking courts at the right times,
                    and staying in sync with local clubs and communities was harder than it should be.

                <p className="text-muted text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
                    They decided to build the platform they wished existed — one place where players, clubs, and organizers can meet,
                    plan, and play without friction. Today, Playdel is growing as both a startup and a community center for the sport:
                    welcoming, organized, and built by people who love the game.
